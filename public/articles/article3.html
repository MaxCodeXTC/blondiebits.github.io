<p>Let’s talk about the <b>developer tools</b> in Google Chrome. Google Chrome is a web browser as we all know and it has some hidden developer tools that we can use to manipulate webpages. To check them out, we'll open up this <a href="http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-grayscale/">live bootstrap website</a> and see what we can do. Keep in mind you can do this with any site.</p>

	<!-- image of the website template -->

<p>To access the <b>DevTools</b> or <b>Inspector</b> in Google Chrome, we just Left Click and select Inspect.</p>

	<!-- image of inspect popup -->

<p>On the right hand side, a side-window will pop up that gives us some options.</p>

	<!-- image of the side-window -->


<div ng-attr-class= "{{ hideorshow }}">

<p>On the top half, we have HTML and on the bottom half, we have CSS. If we hover over some of the HTML elements, the respective parts are highlighted in the actual webpage. </p>

	<!-- image of highlighted components -->

<p>Now, we can actually change some stuff on the webpage with this code over here. Right now, when we click the arrow button on the website, we are redirected to the about section.</p>

	<!-- highlight where the arrow button code is -->

<p>We could change it so that when we click it, we are redirected to the contact section instead. To do this, we’ll change <b>#about</b> to <b>#contact</b>. </p>

	<!-- Change the code so that the arrow button goes to the #contact section (add boxes) -->

<p>And now, when the button is clicked, we go to the contact section.  We just changed the HTML, but we can change the CSS as well - scrolling down, let’s say we want the github button to be red instead of green.</p>
	
	<!-- Picture of github button and inspect -->

<p>We can just go down to this <b>element’s style</b> and set the color property equal to red. </p>

	<!-- Picture of setting the red for this element-->

<p>Now, this only changes this specific github button, but if we want the Twitter and Google+ buttons to be red as well, we need to go down to <b>.btn-default</b> and set its color property to red. This will cause all of the elements that are a part of the .btn-default class to have red text.</p>

	<!-- picture of setting red for this btn-default -->

<p>So we've made some changes to the code... but these changes will not be saved. If we refresh the page, we'll see that our modifications disappear - and this is good because otherwise, everyone would have access to how every website looks.</p>

	<!-- picture of refreshed page -->

<p>Opening up the Inspector here again, there are a couple of other tabs in the side-window that can be useful as well.</p>

	<!-- picture of refreshed page with inspector window-->

<p>The <b>Elements tab</b> that opens when you open the Inspector is the one you’ll probably use the most, but the Console and Source panels are also helpful. </p>

	<!-- picture of console tab -->

<p>The <b>Console</b> will tell you if you have any errors in your code. This is more helpful if you have JavaScript or Angular in your program, but it will help you find any syntax errors and let you know if you are trying to access something that doesn’t exist. </p>

	<!-- picture of source tab -->

<p>The <b>Source panel</b> offers another way to edit the website's code. We could click on the grayscale.min.css or index.html file, change something, and it would have the same effect as if we did it in the Elements tab. Again, remember - none of our changes will be saved no matter where we make them.</p>

	<!-- make a change to the title from the source tab -->

<p>Now, why does this help us? Why do we care that we can do this? Well, I have some of the HTML and CSS code that we created in a previous tutorial and we can open up this HTML webpage...</p>

	<!-- opened webpage with sublime next to it -->

<p>And let’s just say I wanted to see what this header text would look like if it was red. Using the Inspector tool, we could open up the window and style the element to red.</p>

	<!-- opened webpage with styling set and inspector window open -->

<p>This red might be a little bright for my taste so we could make it a little darker by selecting the icon next to red. By clicking different areas on the preview color window, we can see what different shades of red might look like.</p>

	<!-- changing color with preview window -->

<p>We can also sample colors on the website - say take the brown color from this photo.</p>

	<!-- picture of sampling color from photo -->

<p>That looks good to me! However, since none of this is saved, we'll have to copy and paste this hex code and styling into our actual CSS file and save it up. We'll put our header in a div, give it an ID, and then select that ID in the CSS.</p>

	<!-- new html / css for changes -->

<p>Refreshing the page, we now have the styling we want.</p>

	<!-- refreshed webpage -->

<p>That’s the power of the <b>developer tools</b> in Google Chrome. Next Friday will be all about JavaScript, which will actually help make our websites interactive. See you then.</p>
