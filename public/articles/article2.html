<p>Letâ€™s talk about <b>bootstrap</b>. Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework that helps developers make responsive websites. A website is <b>responsive</b> if the layout still looks okay when the size of the window or screen changes. Opening two webpages, if I have one <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> window at near full-screen and another <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> window with a mobile-sized screen, both windows still look good. By "looking good," we mean that the elements of the website get smaller as the window size shrinks and the user can still access everything on the page. This functionality is what we want in our websites. </p>
