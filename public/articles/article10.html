<p><b>GitHub Pages</b> is a <b>static site hosting service</b> that allows us to put our local webpages on the Internet. In order to use GitHub Pages, first you’ll need a <b>GitHub account</b>. GitHub is a website so we can just go to the <a href="www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and create a login.</p>

<!-- picture of login screen -->

 <a href="images/article10/image0.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image0.jpg" alt="" /></a>


<p>Here, keep your account <b>public</b>. It's the free option and just means that anyone can see your projects (which isn't a huge deal right now).</p>

<p>Next, we’ll need to navigate back to the homepage by clicking the <b>cat icon</b> in the top left corner. Once on the homepage, go to your email and click the link to <b>verify</b> so we can create a new project. Once your email is verified, go ahead and press the <b>Start a Project button</b>.</p>

<p>Now, we can set up our project (website) that will be on the Internet. Here, it says <b>Create a Repository</b> and a repository is just another name for project or folder. Don't get too caught up in the terminology for now - just know that this is where the code for our webpage is going to go.</p>

<p>Name your project your <b>username.github.io</b>. So if your username is harrypotter, your project name should be harrypotter.github.io. It is very important that it’s named this way because that’s how we get <b>access</b> to GitHub’s free hosting service (GitHub Pages). Go ahead and keep this project public - which just means anyone can see the code - and initialize it with a <b>README</b>. The README usually contains an in depth description of the project, which you can write later. Clicking submit...</p>

<p>And now we have our project! Now how do we get our website code there? Well, we can just create new files and code it all here <b>online</b> or you could upload files from your computer. Another option is to use the <b>command line</b>, which would allow us to code this locally on our own computer with Sublime and then upload it to GitHub through the text-based terminal. If you are interested in that, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/yTt0-NBHQ4s">GitHub Terminal Pt. 2 video</a>. You could also do this with the <b>applications that GitHub</b> has, but doing it from the terminal feels a lot cooler.</p>

<p>To use the terminal with <b>git</b>, you’ll need to download the git. The easiest way to do this is to download the applications provided by GitHub by clicking <b>Clone or Download</b> and then <b>Open in Desktop</b>. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will just be using the github website to write our code. </p>

<p>To start developing our website, we’ll go ahead and click <b>Create New File</b> and call it <b>index.html</b>. Inside of here, we’ll just create a simple header that says Hello World.</p>

<!-- click new file, show edits -->

 <a href="images/article10/image5.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image5.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>Then, we'll scroll down and commit the change by pressing <b>Commit new file</b>. In the text box, you can add a description about the change you made, but we'll just keep it blank for this tutorial.</p>

<!-- show commit box -->

 <a href="images/article10/image6.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image6.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>Now, if the go to our <b>github.io website</b>, we’ll be able see the results of our code.</p>

<!-- show results of code -->

 <a href="images/article10/image7.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image7.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>And there we see our <b>Hello World</b>. If we go to another computer and try to access this website, we'll also see Hello World. Right now, anyone in the world can go to a <b>yourusername.github.io</b> website and they will see the results of whatever code is written in the yourusername.github.io repository.</p>

<!-- picture of repo with readme and index.html -->

 <a href="images/article10/image8.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image8.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>What if we want this header to say <b>Hello Bob</b> instead? Well, we can go back to GitHub and click the file.</p>

<!-- picture of file clicked, result of that -->

 <a href="images/article10/image9.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image9.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>Then, we can press the <b>pencil icon</b> and edit the file to have Hello Bob instead along with some extra text.</p>

<!-- picture of edits -->

 <a href="images/article10/image10.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article10/image10.jpg" alt="" /></a>

<p>After commiting the change, we can refresh the website and now we see <b>Hello Bob</b> and <b>I am a hacker</b>. If you don't see this change immediately on your website, try waiting five minutes and refresh again.</p>

<p>You just learned how to use <b>GitHub Pages</b>!! Remember, this will only work with <b>static sites</b> so there can’t be any dynamic angular directives or routing going on because that won’t work. However, you can have directives and routing on other hosting sites, such as <b>Heroku</b>. Due to the fact that classes are back in session for me, tutorials might be coming out every two weeks instead of every week. However, the next post will be on <b>how to use Heroku to host your Angular website</b> so that anyone in the world can access that as well. See you then.</p>
