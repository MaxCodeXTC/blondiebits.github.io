		<p>Let’s write some CSS. <b>CSS</b> stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it styles our HTML skeleton code. Building on our project from last time, we’ll create a main.css file that will store all of our styling code. </p>

		<p>In our HTML from before, we had an h3 tag with the text "blue." What if we could actually make the text blue? Well we can with CSS. In our main.css, we'll <b>select</b> all the h3 elements on the HTML page and set their <b>color property</b> equal to the <b>value</b> blue.</p>

		<p>This won't do anything yet because we haven't linked our main.css to our index.html page. To link it, we'll go to our index.html and write a <b>link tag</b>.</p>

		<!-- Pic with one side as html and other as css, but with link tag filled in -->

		<div ng-attr-class= "{{ hideorshow }}">

				<p>If we open the webpage, the h3 text should be blue. If your text isn't blue, make sure that you've saved both of your files and they are both on the same level in your folder. Also, make sure that you spelled main.css correctly in the link tag inside your index.html. </p>

			<p>Now I don't really like this color. I would like a more navy shade of blue. How do we make that happen? Well we have <b>Google</b>. I love Google. We can google "rgb dark blue" and look for some clues on how to do this.</p>

			<!-- picture of google search -->

			<a href="images/article0/image5.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article0/image5.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p>We will click the first link and now we have a bunch of options for colors. Scrolling down, I really like this navy color.</p>

			<!-- picture of the first page scrolled down --> 

			<a href="images/article0/image6.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article0/image6.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p>I have two different ways of putting this navy into my code. I can use the <b>Hex code</b> or the <b>RGB value</b>. The Hex code for the navy color is #000080 and the RGB value is rgb(0, 0, 128). RGB stands for Red Green Blue and it let's us know how much red, green, and blue is in a color. So for navy, there is 0 red, 0 green, and 128 blue. To put this in perspective, white is rgb(255, 255, 255) and black is rgb(0, 0, 0). In our main.css, we will use the RGB value and change the value of the color property from blue to rgb(0, 0, 128). </p>

			<p>Refreshing the page, the h3 tag's text should be a navy blue color.</p>

			<!-- picture of the browser-->

			<p>Now what if we want the text in the h3 tag and the parargraph to be italic? We can group them with something called a <b>div</b>. A div is kind of like a container that can hold many other HTML elements.</p>

			<!-- picture of div code --> 

			<a href="images/article0/image9.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article0/image9.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p>To make the text inside the div italic, we must select the div in the CSS and set a property to italicize the text. Right now, we cannot the select the div because it doesn't have a name. We can add an name by adding a <b>class attribute</b> to the div and giving it the value italic.</p>

			<!-- picture of div italic code --> 

			<a href="images/article0/image10.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article0/image10.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p>More about what a <b>class</b> means in minute, but we can select this div in the CSS using it's class name italic.</p>

			<!-- picture of HTML on one side and CSS selection--> 

			<a href="images/article0/image11.jpg" class="image featured"><img src="images/article0/image11.jpg" alt="" /></a>

			<p>Notice, to select the div, we put a <b>dot</b> in front of the class name, but when we select other HTML elements, we do not have the dot. This is important to remember when coding webpages. Now, another thing we can select in CSS is an <b>id</b>. Just now, we selected a class. However, when using an id, only one div can use the unique id name whereas multiple divs can use the same class name. This will all make more sense in a minute. Going back to our code, we can add another div with the class name italic. Inside this second div, we'll add a list of unordered bulleted items with the <b>ul tag</b> and then add two list items with the <b>li tag.</b></p>

			<!-- picture of HTML with additional div on one side and CSS selection--> 

			<p>We could have also created an ordered list by using an <b>ol tag</b> instead of a ul tag. This would have created a numbered list VS a bulleted list. With this code above, our webpage should have a bulleted list with two italicized items.</p>

			<!-- picture of rendered webpage--> 

			<p>Above, we use our italic class twice - however, we are only allowed to use an id once. In our HTML code, we'll create a new div and add an <b>id attribute</b> with the value bold. Then, we'll select it in our CSS with <b>hashtag bold</b> (#bold) and set its <b>font-weight property</b> to be bold. Notice, because we are selecting an id (instead of a class or a HTML element), we use a hashtag in front of the id name.</p>

			<!-- picture of HTML with ID div on one side and CSS ID selection-->

			<p>In continuing this code, we could give other div's id attributes, but they could not have the value "bold" since we have already used that unique identifier. If we wanted other div's to have the id "bold", then we would need to make a class with the value "bold" instead of an id. Now, let's refresh and see the results.</p>

			<p>These aren't all the properties you can mess with but they are some of the main ones. For more, like changing the background, check out <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/">w3schools</a> or try just googling around. You might be surprised at what you can find on your own. Now, it would take so much time to get everything exactly how we wanted if we wrote every line of CSS ourselves. Is there any easier way? Yes - Think Bootstrap! Bootstrap is a framework that makes styling and formating so much easier if you just want to code up a website quickly. That's what next week's post will be about. See you then.</p>.
